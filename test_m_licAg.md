<br></br>

#### <b>2.1&ensp;   Right to Use and Commercially Distribute </b>

 &ensp;    &ensp;  &ensp; Licensor grants to Licensee a non-exclusive, non-transferable, royalty-free license to use and commercially distribute the machine readable version of the Software and the Documentation, (together the "Licensed Product") solely for the use, operation and commercial distribution of DAC Factory for or in connection with the Activity. 
 
"Use" in this Agreement shall have the meaning, subject to the limitations and restrictions in Section 2.2 below:

<ol type="a">
    <li> &ensp;  &ensp;of using the program code of the Software in a machine-readable form on a computer installation, i.e. inputting the &ensp;  &ensp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; program either totally or partially into a computer system in order to carry out the instructions contained within the program; </li>
    <li>&ensp;  &ensp; storing the program and using its Documentation with any part of the program in connection with the practical &ensp;  &ensp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ensp;  &ensp;&nbspexploitation of DAC Factory</li>
</ol>

 &ensp;  &ensp;"Commercially distribute" in this Agreement shall have the meaning of commercializing DAC Factory towards third parties by granting, against consideration, a sub-license to up to one third party (the "Distributor"). Such sub-license shall allow the Distributor to grant an unlimited number of limited sub-licenses to end users, to allow such end users to use, always subject to the limitations and restrictions in Section 2.2 below, DAC Factory or certain functions thereof against consideration. The Distributor shall not have the right to grant sub-licenses for any further commercial distribution of the Licensed Product. For the avoidance of doubt, Licensee shall have no obligation to grant a sub-license to a Distributor and shall be free in electing, revoking and/or replacing any Distributor from time to time, in observance of the relevant terms of any applicable sub-license agreement. <br></br>
 
#### <b>2.2 &ensp; Restrictions </b><br></br>
 &ensp; &ensp; &ensp; &nbsp;The right to use the Licensed Product is subject to the following restrictions:
 
  &ensp; &ensp; &ensp; &nbsp;Subject to the Licensee's right to commercially distribute DAC Factory and Section 2.3, Licensee shall not, and shall not permit any third party, to copy, modify or adapt the Licensed Product nor create derivative works based upon the Licensed Product.<br></br>

#### <b> 2.3  &ensp;New Releases / Versions  </b><br></br>
&ensp; &ensp; &ensp; &nbsp;If Licensor develops new releases or versions of the License Product it shall make them available to the Licensee based on the terms of this Agreement. In case Licensee has any specific need for any modification, further development, extension of the Software, the Parties shall agree together on which Party shall be responsible for the implementation thereof and how the costs shall be allocated between the Parties. If the Parties Agree that Licensee shall be responsible, Licensor shall make the source code to the extent required for such purpose available to Licensee. Section 4 applies in respect to the ownership in any such modification, further development, extension etc. of the Software.<br></br>


#### <b> 2.4&ensp;  Assignment and Sub-licensing </b><br></br>
&ensp; &ensp; &ensp; Subject to the Licensee's right under Section 2.1 to commercially distribute DAC Factory, the license granted hereunder is personal to Licensee and Licensee is not entitled to sub-license any of the rights granted to it hereunder without the prior consent (by Written Notice) of Licensor. Licensee must not assign or transfer the license or any part thereof to any third party.
<br></br>

### &ensp; <b>3&ensp;&nbsp;  Delivery</b><br></br>
&ensp; &ensp; &ensp;&nbsp;The Licensee acknowledges that it has obtained a copy of the Software and the Documentation, including all the files, documents and information required to operate DAC Factory.<br></br>

### &ensp; <b> 4&ensp;&nbsp; Rights regarding DAC Factory</b><br></br>

&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&nbsp;&ensp;Licensee acknowledges that the Licensed Product is proprietary to Licensor and any and all patents, copyrights and other intellectual property rights which subsist in or arise in connection with DAC Factory, the Software (including the source code) and Documentation, including in any new release, version or any other further development (including such made based on Section 2.3), anywhere in the world belong to Licensor and that Licensee shall have no right in or to DAC Factory or Licensed Product except for the right to use it and commercially distribute it as permitted by this Agreement. Nothing in this Agreement restricts Licensor's freedom to use, license or otherwise exploit, and modify, change or further develop DAC Factory and Licensed Product for its own, its affiliates or any third party's business purposes.<br></br>


### &ensp; <b>5&ensp;&nbsp;  No License Fee</b><br></br>

&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&nbsp; Licensor grants the license hereunder free of charge and Licensee shall therefore have no obligation to pay a fee to Licensor under this Agreement. <br></br>

### &ensp; <b>6&ensp;&nbsp;  Record Keeping</b><br></br>
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&nbsp;  Licensee shall maintain complete, clear, and accurate records to substantiate the underlying sub-licensing proceeds during the term of this Agreement. Licensee shall continue to maintain these reports and records for a period of two years after the termination date of this Agreement. Licensor shall have the right to access, inspect and receive a copy of any such reports and records at any time, upon ten days prior notice.<br></br>

### &ensp;  <b>7&ensp;&nbsp; Representations and Warranties </b><br></br>
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&nbsp; The Licensed Product is provided to Licensee on an "as is"-basis. Licensor does not make any representation or give any warranty in respect to any characteristics of the Licensed Product. In particular, Licensor does not represent and warrant that the Software runs uninterrupted and error-free or that the use of the Licensed Product is fit for any particular purpose and does not infringe upon any third party's intellectual property rights. All warranties are expressly excluded.<br></br>

### &ensp;  <b>8&ensp;&nbsp; Infringement Proceedings </b><br></br>
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&nbsp;Each Party shall defend itself at its own costs against any infringement claim or action raised by any third party based on the argument that the Licensed Product and its use infringes any copyright or any other intellectual property rights of a third party. Licensor does not assume any liability in this respect. <br></br>

### &ensp;  <b>9&ensp;&nbsp; Indemnity</b><br></br>
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&nbsp; Licensee shall indemnify Licensor against all claims, liabilities and expenses incurred by Licensor or any of its affiliates (other than Licensor) and arising out of or in connection with the use and commercial distribution of DAC Factory and the Licensed Product by Licensee and its sub-licensees. <br></br>

### &nbsp; <b>10&ensp;&nbsp;Liability </b> <br></br>
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&nbsp;Subject to Section 9, either party's liability to the other (whether contractual or otherwise) with respect to this Agreement and the use and operation of DAC Factory and Licensed Product respectively shall be limited to damages resulting from willful misconduct or gross negligence or death or personal injury caused by a Party.<br></br>

### &nbsp; <b>11&ensp;&nbsp;  Term and Termination  </b><br></br>
 
#### <b>11.1&ensp;&nbsp;Term  </b> <br></br>
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This Agreement shall be in effect from the Effective Date and, unless terminated in accordance with Sections 11.2 and 11.3 below, this Agreement and the licenses granted hereunder shall extend to the entire term of copyright or other intellectual property protection of the Licensed Product. <br></br>

#### <b>11.2&ensp;&nbsp;Termination by Licensee </b><br></br>
 &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Licensee may terminate this Agreement at any time upon three months prior notice. <br></br>
 
#### <b>11.3&ensp;&nbsp;Termination by Licensor  </b><br></br>
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Licensor may terminate this Agreement with immediate effect by giving notice to Licensee, only if:
<ol type="a">
    <li>&ensp;  &ensp;Licensee ceases to conduct the Activity;</li><br></br>
    <li>&ensp;  &ensp;Licensee or any of its sub-licensees fails to perform or observe any of the obligations on its part to be performed  or observed under this Agreement, provided, however, Licensor has required Licensee by Written Notice to&ensp; &ensp; &ensp; &ensp;&ensp;&nbsp; remedy such breach of this Agreement, or to procure that such breach is remedied, within 30 days and Licensee or the related sub-licensee has not cured such breach or done all acts one can reasonably require to deem such breach cured within such 30 days period; or</li><br></br>
    <li>&ensp;  &ensp;Licensor ceases to be a member of the board of custodians of Licensee and is not re-elected in such capacity within a period of 30 days.</li>
</ol><br></br>

### &nbsp; <b>12&ensp;&nbsp;Effects of Termination</b><br></br>
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&nbsp; Upon termination for any reason all rights granted to the Licensee under this Agreement shall cease, the Licensee shall cease, and procure that its sub-licensees cease, to use and, as the case may be, to commercially distribute, the Licensed Product. For the avoidance of doubt, any and all DAC(s) generated or otherwise created by Licensee or any sub-licensee through the use of DAC Factory shall remain unaffected by a termination of this Agreement and neither Licensee, nor any sub-licensee, nor any officer or member of the relevant DAC(s) shall be restricted in the use of the relevant smart contract and/or any other underlying code of the DAC(s) they have generated using DAC Factory in the event of a termination of this Agreement. <br></br>

<br></br>

## &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Annex</b><br></br>

&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Description of DAC Factory The DAC Factory is software for 


<ol type="a">
    <li>&ensp;building and configuring the smart contracts (in a point and click way) to create a DAC; and </li>
    <li>&ensp;configuring the member client (web portal) that presents on-chain information and allows users to interact with on- chain commands</li>
</ol>
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The DAC Factory configures the on-chain contracts which set the configurable variables defining key aspects of the DAC (like number and term of custodians, number of tokens etc.). It sets up an API and configures and builds the member client (web portal). It receives payments and updates links payment with the provision of the service (i.e. if the Customer doesn‚Äôt renew, the service including the member client (web portal) becomes unavailable to them). For the avoidance of doubt, DAC Factory, as licensed under the Agreement, does not include a front end (i.e. user interface), which Licensee shall provide itself. DAC Factory hereunder shall designate the software as upgraded from time to time.
