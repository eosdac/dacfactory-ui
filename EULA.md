Dacoco may use this information in a form which does not identify individuals.

# 10. Breach and Remedies

You understand and agree that observance of your obligations hereunder is of significant importance to Dacoco and that, if you breach this Agreement, Dacoco would incur serious losses and other detrimental consequences which might not easily be cured.

If you breach any provision of or undertaking under this Agreement, we shall have the right to seek specific performance (_"Realexekution"_) in respect of your obligations under this Agreement, including but not limited to the right to request that you cease and/or desist from committing any breach of such obligations, whether or not this forces you to abandon any commercial activity or not to pursue any opportunities at that time (cease and desist injunction).

Dacoco has the right to seek interim legal protection (_"Vorsorgliche Massnahmen"_) to prevent detrimental consequences and effects that cannot easily be remedied or to ensure an effective enforcement of your obligations under this Agreement. In such event, you fully waive any right you may have under applicable laws to request the provision of securities (_"Sicherheitsleistung"_) by Dacoco.

# 11. Liability

# 12. Term and Termination

This Agreement shall remain in effect for a term of 30 calendar days, beginning on the date on which Dacoco receives the Up Front Fee. Upon expiry of such initial term, this Agreement shall remain in effect for successive additional terms of 30 calendar days each, unless terminated by either Party no later than 15 days prior the end of the relevant term.

This Agreement (and therefore your and, as the case may be, Your DAC's right to make Permitted Use of the Product) shall be terminated with immediate effect in the event that an Incremental Fee is not paid within the applicable 10 day period.

In addition, Dacoco may terminate this Agreement if, in our sole discretion, we determine that there has been a breach of security, a material breach of any other agreement between the Parties or a violation of law. If the cause of the suspension is reasonably capable of being remedied, we will provide you notice of what actions you must take to reinstate the Product or otherwise, a state acceptable to us within our full discretion. If you fail to take such actions or the cause cannot be remedied within 10 calendar days, we may terminate this Agreement.

You may terminate the Agreement immediately upon written notice if we commit a material breach and fail to cure such material breach within 10 calendar days.

Upon termination, all licenses end immediately. You will return the Product to us or uninstall and destroy it. Termination of the Agreement will not relieve you of your obligation to pay us any amounts you owe up to and including the date of termination.

Either party may terminate the agreement in part as it relates to any Product that is licensed or ordered under the agreement if and to the extent that Product is no longer commercially available.

# 13. Miscellaneous

You may not assign any of your rights or obligations hereunder, whether by operation of the law or otherwise.

## 13.3. No Waiver

## 13.4. Severability

If any provision, or portion of a provision, contained in the Agreement is invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions, or the remaining portion of such provision, shall remain in full force and effect.

To the maximum extent allowed under applicable laws, all disputes under or in connection with this Agreement shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the ordinary courts of Zug, Switzerland, and each of the parties undertakes to fully subject itself to such jurisdiction, always provided that each of the parties shall be entitled to seek preliminary measures and injunctive relief before any competent court according to applicable law.
